    "text": "Selection procedures for 180DC are held at the start of the autumn semester. New recruits are taken in from the first year only. The selection procedure consists of multiple rounds of interviews and discussions wherein prospective members aren’t judged on their knowledge of consultancy frameworks, but rather their problem-solving approach and whether they are able to present their thoughts in a structured manner.\nThe selection procedure evaluates the candidates on Structured Thinking, Problem Solving, Work Ethic, Time Management, Speaking, Writing and Design skills . Good knowledge of business and finance is appreciated but is not the main factor of evaluation. We expect an optimal amount of time and dedication.",
