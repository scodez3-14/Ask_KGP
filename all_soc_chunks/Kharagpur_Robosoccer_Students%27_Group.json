    "text": "Kharagpur Robosoccer Students' Group , often abbreviated to KRSSG , is one of IIT Kharagpur's first endeavours in robotics research. It is a research group sponsored by SRIC as part of Centre for Excellence in Robotics . The aim of the research group is to make autonomous soccer-playing robots and participate in international competitions like Robocup and FIRA Roboworld Cup . Undergraduate students from all departments and years are a part of this team. The principal investigator for the project is Prof. A.K. Deb and it is also mentored by Prof. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay , Prof. D.K. Pratihar and Prof. Sudeshna Sarkar. [ 1 ]",

    "text": "The roots of KRSSG lie with Technology Robotix Society as one of the alumni, Aamir Ahmad interned at the Institute for Systems and Robotics (ISR) under Prof. Pedro Lima (former trustee, Robocup Federation), convincing him to bring Robocup to India. Robocup@India challenge was organised by IIT Kharagpur in 2009. This event was the first of its kind in South East Asia and with this India joined the elite body of only 18 nations worldwide to host such a league. Students of IIT Kharagpur itself participated in this event, forming KRSSG. Following the event, KRSSG got faculty attention which prompted Prof. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay and Prof. Sudeshna Sarkar to formally take it up as a research project under them in 2010. This gave KRSSG its first funding from the institute and students started to join the group. With Sanjiban Choudhury and Kaustubh Tripathy taking it as their Bachelor's and Master's Thesis Projects, KRSSG soon grew to expand to a group of 10 students aiming to participate in FIRA 2010. KRSSG participated in FIRA 2010 with purchased robots, held in Bangalore with Sanjiban as the sole representative since it was during mid-semester exams. Although the team was eliminated in the first round, the international exposure proved to be very useful. [ 1 ]\nFIRA 2013 Team\nFollowing this, the team started to design their own chassis and circuits. KRSSG then next attempted to participate in FIRA 2012 in Bristol, UK. The team, led by Gaurav Rathi, were all set to leave when their visa was denied. The next iteration, FIRA 2013, was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia which saw successful participation. The mechanical design, circuit fabrication, control code and the AI were all developed by students of the group. FIRA Malaysia was also KRSSG's maiden entry into the Simurosot simulation league. KRSSG was one of only two teams who were using self-manufactured robots in the event along with Team Sahas from IIT Madras. Moreover, FIRA 2013 was the first time an Indian team won a match in FIRA. [ 1 ]\nFollowing this, KRSSG participated in FIRA 2014 Beijing, China and FIRA 2015 Daejeon, South Korea. [ 1 ]",
