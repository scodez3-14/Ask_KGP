SHARE seeks individuals who can manage their time effectively and demonstrate a high level of professionalism within the team.", "page": "ShARE"}, {"chunk_id": "1adb50f9", "title": "Learning Culture", "text": "At SHARE, the primary mode of learning for first-year students is through knowledge meetings, where senior members lead sessions to introduce and explain essential consulting functions such as market research, strategy development, pricing analysis, and data-driven decision-making. These sessions not only facilitate learning but also foster active discussions and strengthen relationships between peers and senior members.\nSHARE further enhances experiential learning through intra-team competitions specifically designed for first-year students. These include a traditional case study challenge, an equity research report, and a distinctive event called Bid to Pitch . In Bid to Pitch , participants begin by conceptualizing a startup idea and delivering a brief pitch to their peers. After the pitches, teams bid on the ideas they find most promising, effectively \"purchasing\" one to develop further. They then transform the chosen concept into a comprehensive, real-world business plan and deliver a final presentation that simulates an actual product or company launch. These initiatives are crafted to cultivate creativity, strategic thinking, and collaboration in a dynamic, hands-on environment.", "page": "ShARE"}, {"chunk_id": "8e7f86c3", "title": "Events", "text": "\u2022 Case Study Competition : To develop critical thinking and business acumen, first-year students examine and offer strategic answers to real-world problems that businesses face.\n\u2022 Bid to Pitch : In order to foster entrepreneurial thinking and valuation skills, participants bid on startup ideas and pitch business models, simulating investment decisions.\n\u2022 Equity Research Report : Students gain experience with financial analysis and stock evaluation by creating expert-caliber equity research reports on publicly traded companies.", "page": "ShARE"}, {"chunk_id": "7d63beb8", "title": "Organizational Hierarchy", "text": "\u2022 Advisors are the senior-most members of SHARE, typically in their fourth or fifth year.
