Kharagpur. It was founded in 1967 by Mr. R.K Bagrodia.\nPravah comes under the Technology Students' Gymkhana and is a part of the Dramatics Subcommittee under the Social and Cultural Committee. Since its inception, Pravah has been highly successful in bringing the true spirit of theatre to life and in demonstrating the power of emotions and thoughts through its stage plays and nukkad nataks (Street Plays).\nThe society although, does not hold any bias to a particular language and does not consider proficiency in Hindi as a metric during selections , which is evident from the fact that many of its members are not well versed in Hindi, but continue to contribute with great enthusiasm.\nThe Pravah family, with 112 active members currently, boasts of individuals with a keen sense of theatrical and street art! Our members have also brought accolades to their halls with their performances in Hall dramatics and have featured in various Short Films for various productions by the Filmmaking club for Inter IIT Cultural Meets.", "page": "Pravah"}, {"chunk_id": "568cbd9a", "title": "Selection Procedure", "text": "Pravah auditions are held once per year, for the first years, in the first or second week of August for active membership for all four/five years. The society selects a batch of around 35 first years (UG/PG) at the beginning of the academic year soon after the welcome production. The selection procedure consists of tasks that judge voice modulation, intensity, speech and diction, confidence, and acting skills.\nIt is not at all necessary that you must have a proper hold of Hindi, to be a part of Pravah. Also in rare cases, auditions have been held for a second time if it is found that a lot of people have missed the selections.", "page": "Pravah"}, {"chunk_id": "207b892a", "title": "Organizational Structure", "text": "Pravah has four governors appointed every year who govern the society and represent it in the Technology Student's Gymkhana.
