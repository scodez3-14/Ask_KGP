Input Modeling: fitting distributions to data, selecting distributions without data, nonstationary arrival processes, multivariate input models. Output Analysis: point and interval estimation for means, probabilities and quantiles. Experiment Design: terminating vs. steady-state simulation, determining number of reps/batches for fixed precision, initial bias mitigation, use of common random numbers and antithetic variates. Variate Generation: pseudorandom number generators, inverse cdf transformation, nonstationary arrival processes, multivariate input models Using Simulation in Research: experiment within an experiment approach\nBooks \u2022J.
