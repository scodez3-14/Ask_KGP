This paradigm emphasizes on theintegration of data, knowledge, and tools necessary for efficient knowledge discovery inthe decision-making process associated with information extraction and computationalintelligence. It can be found at the heart of many electronic signal processing systemsdesigned to extract information. These systems include Radar, Sonar, Speech, ImageAnalysis, Biomedicine, Control, Communications and Seismology. It is therefore animportant goal to develop this subject addressing the requirements and to train thestudents in understanding the above-specified applications for development of efficientdecision-making system having better signal handling capabilities.Objective:\u2022 To develop an in-depth understanding with the basic theoretical knowledge andpractical experience from the area of embedded systems.\u2022 To know the various statistical techniques for processing and visualization of digitalinformation on the MATLAB.Contents:Course Content LectureAdaptive Systems and adaptive linear combiner, input signals and weightvectors, Performance function, MMSE -- 3 hourMethod of Steepest Descent and LMS adaptive filters, Stability andRobustness of LMS filter, Normalised LMS filter, Tracking performance. -- 6 hourMVDR spectrum estimation Recursive least square adaptive filters, SquareRootAdaptive filters,QR-RLS algorithm, Tracking performance -- 6 hourIIR Adaptive filters: Output Error method and Equation error methodBlind Deconvolution, Bussgang Algorithm --5 hourApplications: Adaptive modeling in FIR digital Filter Synthesis, Adaptivemodeling of a multipath communication channel and Adaptive interferencecancellation -- 5 hourSensor Array Processing:Array Fundamentals, Conventional Spatial Filtering, BeamformerClassification, Data Independent Beamforming, Optimum BeamformingMultiplesidelobe canceller, SNR maximization -- 6 hourDirection-ofarrival estimation: Subspace-based methods-Signal and Noisesubspace methods: Search-based method, Algebraic method (MinimumVariance, AR, Subspace fitting, MUSIC) --5 hourArray processing for mobile communications: Vector channel models,Performance consideration: Effect of Signal Mismatch, Bandwidth, Correlatedarrivals, MMSE beamformer, Peak-to-Average power ratio reduction, Analysisof adaptive Beamformer8 hourConclusions, Feedback, Expectations 1Recommended Text Books/Reference Books:Adaptive Filter Theory By Simon Haykin, W.
