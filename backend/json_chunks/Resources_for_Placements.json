The interviews may be of the following types :\n\u2022 Case Interviews : They are the most important/difficult interviews for a consulting job. The question may or may not involve numbers. Be sure to ask as many questions as you can, and be at your presentable best.\n\u2022 Guesstimates/ Data Interpretation : The structure and methodology is far more important in these questions, than to get the numbers right.\n\u2022 HR Interviews : This involves usual HR questions with a special preference to how presentable the candidate is, to potential clients and also on what the candidate is really interested in, as consulting companies face attrition problems all the time.\n\u2022 \"Tell me something about yourself, walk me through your resume.\"\n\u2022 \"What's the most challenging environment/work you've faced?\"\n\u2022 \"Why consulting? Why the firm? Why you?\"\n\u2022 \"Where do you see yourself 5/10 years later?\"\n\u2022 \"What are your strengths?

This test has short programming questions and at times knowledge questions on programming languages. Most common questions on programming languages are on C,C++ or Java. After you qualify the coding test, you get shortlisted for the interview, usually for all the SDE positions. The general process consists of 2-3 technical rounds followed by 1 HR round. Some companies (Usually Microsoft) has a Group Discussion Round too to shortlist where they give a design question of a system where everyone is asked to collaborate and discuss on how to design the specified system as Company employees judge on how much a candidate contributes. In the technical rounds, they ask 2-3 coding questions which you have to code on paper(proper syntax and everything, not pseudo code) and/or domain related questions from DBMS, Networks, OS and ML(if mentioned in the resume). The biggest focus is on whether you can find an optimal algorithm to solve the given problem/ implementation, and then code it in a reasonable amount of time.\n\u2022 The coding questions are usually from DP or graph theory. Definitely brush up on your C++/Java skills - Base class / Super Class / OOP / Abstraction / Encapsulation\n\u2022 Preparing for the typical HR questions is a must. Other than that you should have \"introduce yourself\" prepared and oriented to the company position that you are applying to.\n\u2022 Explain one of the projects that you have worked on, in detail.
