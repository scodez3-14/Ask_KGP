The first half of the course dealt largely with surface phenomena and the latter half with crystallization and models for quantifying them. The course is not very demanding in terms of time required to study, however some concepts in the latter half of the course requires a few iterations.\nPros: It is a good course if you are interested in population balance, surface phenomena etc, and most of the topics covered are readily available in the book suggested by the professor\nCons: Sometimes there is lack of structure in the course.", "page": "CH60026: Fundamentals Of Particle Technology"}]
