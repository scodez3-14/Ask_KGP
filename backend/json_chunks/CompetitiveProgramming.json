So let's list all of them, once and for all.\n\u2022 Whatsapp group : Yeah there exists quite active Whatsapp group for Competitive Programming. Whatsapp Invite for CP Interview Group. : Do not join the latter group, if you're preparing for interviews, as the discussion most of the time is on topics not needed for interviews.

Almost all of them follow the same format, where you are given a problem, and you have to write and submit code that will solve the problem. Your solution will be checked on some test cases and you'll be given a verdict depending on, if your program outputs to all the test cases correctly, or not, or if it ends up having a segmentation fault.", "page": "CompetitiveProgramming"}, {"chunk_id": "fe346f06", "title": "Programming Websites", "text": "\u2022 Spoj : Spoj is a problem archive. It has many easy problems to help you, if you are just starting with competitive programming. You can sort the problems by number of submissions, and solve first few (say 25 or 30 or 50) problems. The problem with Spoj is that, after sometime you will find it boring because problems here are repititive, and finding good problems is difficult here. This is the website where you can find the classical problem (problem that asks you to directly implement a standard algorithm or trick) for any algorithm.\n\u2022 Codechef : If you're just begining with competitive programming, you can right away start with Codechef's. It holds atleast three contests a month. The best thing about codechef is its Long challenges, which are aimed for beginners. Each long challenge starts on first friday of every month and lasts for 10 days, and therefore you get enough time to think about problems, debug the codes, and search the internet to learn related things. It also hosts two short contests, Codechef Cook off, and Codechef Lunchtime. Lunchtime consists of more mathematical and ad-hoc problems.\n\u2022 Codeforces : This is the most used competitive programming website. It has a lot of features, including problem ratings, virtual contests, gym, mashups, and better problems. It hosts 5-6 short contests every month. Once you are familiar with problem solving on codechef, start solving problems on codeforces too. Start participating in contests here, once you gain some confidence. Comparing to interview problems, almost no interview problem is harder than Codeforces Div2D.\n\u2022 Atcoder : It holds contests quite irregualry, but the quality of problems is far better than any of the other programming platform. Start solving problems here, once you are comfortable with codeforces problems, and wants to improve your problem solving skills.\n\u2022 Interviewbit : This website contains minimal problems to get you acquainted through Competitive Programming needed to crack interviews, if you are short on time. Once you are familiar with basics needed for Competitive Programming, and want to prepare for interviews, this is the place you should head to. Even if you are already too good at Competitive Programming, I would suggest you to solve interviewbit to get a taste of problems that are asked in interview.\n\u2022 LeetCode : If you want to solve more interview-related problems on some specific topics other than the ones on interviewbit, then LeetCode covers that for you.

It's always a good idea to calculate the time complexity of your algorithms before you start implementing it. A rule of thumb is that 10^7 operations can pass in 1 second on any programming judge, but if you're not using any of the costly operations like modulo, and overhead of your program is less, then 10^8 operations may pass too.\n\u2022 Now you're all set to solve problems.

Directly start solving problems from interviewbit, but make sure to finish almost all problems in the above article before that. Once you're done with interviewbit, you can move on to LeetCode for further practice, and I'm pretty sure, that it is enough for cracking almost all interviews.\n\u2022 The article further focuses on, how to improve further in Competitive Programming.

While the gap in rating is just 300 points, it is certainly more hard than getting to 1800 from 1500.\nAnd as I have experienced over time, only people who have been doing competititve programming regularly, and participating in atleast every other contest, have been able to reach 1900 and manage it for a couple of contests.", "page": "CompetitiveProgramming"}, {"chunk_id": "6bf35d85", "title": "What problems to solve?", "text": "Just solving contest problems regularly will keep you busy.

It not only helps you in figuring out the corner cases, but also in getting more insight into the problem. And, I'm pretty sure if people knew that this ability grows so quickly over time, more people would be doing it.\n\u2022 Dunning-Kruger Effect , and the fact that it applies to Competitive Programming so well, is my favourite thing to talk about. The origin is the point, when you start Competitive Programming, and find it so hard, that you may take hours, and sometimes days to debug your code. Everything seems so new, every problems seems to use a different algorithm, and you feel like you do not have talent needed to excel in CP. But as soon as you solve enough problems, you start observing the patterns, and you realise that most problems are just ad-hocs, using some trivial data-structures. The peak point is when you are rated 1700-1800 on codeforces. You think that you know all there is to know, and that you rating doesn't represent your true level. Your rating is low just because you miss some problems in contests during the last minute, or you couldn't debug it before the contest ended. No Karen, your rating represents your true level, if you think that it doesn't then increase your rating. Numbers don't lie. The minima comes when you're just on the boundary of purple and blue. You are afraid to give any contest because that might decrease your rating. So you avoid participating, because you think that you do not deserve to be purple, it is just purely by chance. Participate in contests. Even if you lose rating in a few contests, you will gain it back. You deserved it :) Don't fall prey for Dunning-Kruger Effect :) Improve your implementation skills. Be time efficient in short contests, have clear thought process.Upsolving is the most important. Make sure you have breadth knowledge of theory. DO NOT focus more on rating (be patient :)).

What should I do now? Chances are that you are solving only easier problems, until you start solving problems that are outside your comfort zone chances are high that you will not improve. Or, it might be the case that you're only under the impression that you're solving problems, while most of the time you're just scrolling through codeforces blogs, and choosing a problem. In that case, see the number, for they never lie :) . How many problems did you solve in the last month? 20 is not a good answer, if you're saying that you're practicing regularly. But I must mention that even if you're solving a lot of problems, and that too outside your comfort zone, you may not see any improvement. In that case keep patience. my cf-rating graph Eventhough I was practicing a lot during my third semester, I was stuck in between cyan and blue (mostly on the cyan side :( ), but soon after I had a steep curve, which I did not expect at all. These times come with lots of demotivation and self-disappointment but that's how it works, you cannot improve in a day. You have to give it time.\n\u2022 How much time should I spend on a problem? My advice is to spend time on a problem as long as you find it interesting. It's only when you start finding it boring, go for the editorial.\nWe want to build this FAQs section.
