It is the event that everyone participates in (willingly or otherwise) for a whole month. All for a matka of sweets! The ILU part really takes a lot more time (cleaning diyas, wiring them, drawing chatais, etc...) a shortage of man-power on the actual event date greatly restricts plans. However, SN has been doing very well in Rangoli off-late. A picture of the '96 rangoli (3rd position) is given above.\n\u2022 Hall-day - The one time of the year when you can bring guests to your room (without having to be critically ill!). The hall is decorated with lights and all, everybody buys a lot of food, and the E-TMS very obligingly puts up a performance. Authorities are usually worried about 'uninvited-guests'... so residents have to set up an extensive 'security' system to check for invitations.\n\u2022 Fresher's welcome- Just as the name suggests, it marks the end of the OP. Restrictions have now made it very hard to have an OP of any sort but the fresher's welcome still is the greatest source of entertainment.\n\u2022 Sophomore Party - Just as the name suggests, it marks the welcome of sophomores in the hall. Nowadays freshers are allocated IGH and onboarding of second years happens in snig not freshers anymore so we have this party and its there first party in the hall and it is the greatest source of entertainment and it marks the beginning of hall bonding\n\u2022 Final year Farewell - The final year farewell is markedly sober... ending in massive senti sessions with the final years handing out perps awards. It involves an extensively planned programme, a catwalk, a 'Miss SN' competition and some 'best senior in such and such awards'. This is accompanied by special dinner (where the mess ammas actually put up a good show) and ends in a lot of tempo shouts and dancing.", "page": "Snig"}]
