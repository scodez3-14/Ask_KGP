In initial stages, the questions can appear straightforward but the complexity increases when we talk about sequences/series of a function. If you were not attentive during start, you will find it difficult to stay with the course work after mid sems. Also, the applications of the things taught in this course can be useful later on in other courses.\nThe course is easily one of the most interesting course of the Department. The course is very well planned. The course starts from very fundamental questions like What actually a Real Number is? How did human intuition firstly think of Real Number?. The course offers a great platform for thinking and answers many things that we have just accepted in our childhood. The course starts from defining a Real Number,Defining sequences about it,Analyzing their properties,Defining functions about them and Defining sequences about the function. Most of the course may seem very obvious to many but the course offers good platform for Higher Mathematics to be learnt later", "page": "MA31005: Real Analysis"}, {"chunk_id": "4a69a7d8", "title": "Time Table", "text": "Day | 8:00-8:55 am | 9:00-9:55 am | 10:00-10:55 am | 11:00-11:55 am | 12:00-12:55 pm | 2:00-2:55 pm | 3:00-3:55 pm | 4:00-4:55 pm | 5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday | NC333\nThursday | NC333\nFriday | NC333 | NC333", "page": "MA31005: Real Analysis"}]
