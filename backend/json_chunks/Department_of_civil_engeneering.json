Since its initiation in 2009, Megalith has conquered a huge success in the field of engineering and corporate sector and has grown as largest Civil Engineering Technical Fest of India. Megalith offers a diverse range of competitions, workshops and guest lectures. The sole objective of Megalith is to promote and encourage ideas and innovation in the field of civil engineering and it strives to present a platform to the civil engineering students to work and interact with several civil engineering aspects. Many new initiatives were successfully undertaken in Megalith 2015. Events like Model Exhibition and Rotolare were conducted for the first time and turned out to be a great success. We at Megalith, do not aim to just put up a fest, our vision is to reach every interested student, professor, personnel from the industry and bring them together, pool their resources together to bring up solutions to the most important challenge in India\u2019s development \u2013 infrastructure. We focus to create a platform for the students to showcase their talent in civil engineering and help them shape a good career for themselves in this field, we envision a fest which is uniquely different from any other college fest of the kind, with a strong motive and purpose.", "page": "Department of civil engeneering"}]
