To measure the high resistance by the method of leakage of charge of a charged conductor. 6. To find the mutual inductance of two coils set at different angles by direct method. 7. To determine the self \u2013inductance of a given coil by Owen\u2019s bridge. 8. To study the phenomena of refraction, interference, absorption and polarization of the microwaves. 9. Verification of Beer\u2019s law using spectrophotometer. 10. To draw the calibration curve (D- lambda curve) of a given prism and hence to find the wavelengths of some unknown lines. 11. To determine the velocity of electromagnetic waves by using luminous diode and photodiode (light receiver). 12. To study the polarisation of light by simple reflection method. 13. To determine the wavelength of Sodium light by using bi-prism. 14. To study the variation of refractive index with the wavelength and hence to determine the dispersive power of the material of a given prism. 15.Interference and diffraction of microwaves.", "page": "PH29008: Electromagnetism %26 Optics Lab"}]
