Each group's viva can go on to roughly 15 minutes and questions are mostly asked on different topic to each member of the group. The questions are according to experiments and, in worst cases, there could be cross questioning from the experiment your partner is being asked from. Below are some example questions:\n\u2022 What is a low pass filter and a high pass filter?\n\u2022 Draw the circuit for high pass filter with RC and RL components? Also draw the graph for it's characteristics.\n\u2022 What is 3dB cutoff frequency? Write the equation.\n\u2022 Draw the adder circuit.\n\u2022 Draw the circuit for inverting Op-Amp configuration.\n\u2022 Why common emmiter configuration is used as amplifier?\n\u2022 Cause of Early effect.\n\u2022 Draw the input output characteristics of C-E amplifier.\n\u2022 What is the need to study signal handling capacity of C-E amplifier?", "page": "EC29001: Basic Electronics Lab."}, {"chunk_id": "10da01e4", "title": "CIC Lab Test:", "text": "A lab test is done in CIC soon after the viva for all the students taking the course.

The student is supposed to perform some part(s) of the experiment and the following is provided:\n- Detailed objective for each part (NO PROCEDURE IS PROVIDED). E.g. Find signal handling capacity for the given circuit when load resistance is infinite and resistance across emitter is bypassed (from CE Amplifier experiment).\n- A diagram (specifically of the parts to be performed) of the circuit is provided.", "page": "EC29001: Basic Electronics Lab."}, {"chunk_id": "4c6e2412", "title": "Classroom resources", "text": "14ME Batch Course Repository\nLab manuals", "page": "EC29001: Basic Electronics Lab."}, {"chunk_id": "2902acf0", "title": "Time Table", "text": "Day | 8:00-8:55 am | 9:00-9:55 am | 10:00-10:55 am | 11:00-11:55 am | 12:00-12:55 pm | 2:00-2:55 pm | 3:00-3:55 pm | 4:00-4:55 pm | 5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday | In Dept | In Dept | In Dept\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday | In Dept | In Dept | In Dept\nFriday", "page": "EC29001: Basic Electronics Lab."}]
