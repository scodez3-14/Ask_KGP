You need to have taken the 2 courses or convince the Professor that you already know these topics. Quantum Mechanics is a bit hard topic. So in the short time, it might be difficult to grasp the ideas of Quantum Mechanics, if you studying it for the first time in this course. A bit of self-study is needed to understand Quantum Mechanics part of this course, if the pace of the course is fast.\nThe second half of the course Quantum Computing, requires minimum basics discussed in the first half of the course. Linear Algebra basics come into use here. Just following the classes will be helpful to understand the topics.", "page": "TS70006: Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing"}, {"chunk_id": "881bea57", "title": "Classroom resources", "text": "Quantum Mechanics:\n\u2022 Assignment 1 - 2021\n\u2022 Assignment 1 - 2021 Solutions - UNVERIFED\n\u2022 Assignment 2 - 2021\n\u2022 Quiz 2020\nQuantum Computing:\n\u2022 Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Nielsen and Chuang : First 2 chapters are good enough for the course\n\u2022 Quantum Computing for Computer Scientist : Algorithms are well explained in this book\n\u2022 Assignment 2021\n\u2022 Assignment 2021 Solutions - UNVERIFED\n\u2022 Previous Year Assignments 2019\n\u2022 Exam with Solutions 2021", "page": "TS70006: Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing"}, {"chunk_id": "e19d24bd", "title": "Additional Resources", "text": "\u2022 Linear Algebra 3blue1brown Playlist MIT OCW Lectures by Prof. Gilbert Strang\n\u2022 Quantum Mechanics Lectures by Professor Susskind - One of the Best introductory Lectures MIT OCW Lectures Quantum Physics I - Prof. Allan Adams and Prof. Barton - If you want to get a deeper understanding of QM and have time\n\u2022 Quantum Computing Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Nielsen and Chuang Quantum Computing for Computer Scientist Qiskit Textbook : A good place to read and implement - both basics and algorithms", "page": "TS70006: Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing"}]
