Second quantisation: canonical quantisation of free Klein-Gordon, Dirac and photon fields. Interaction: Feynman rules and diagrams; scattering cross sections; Phi4 theory and QED processes. Elementary ideas of non-Abelian gauge theories (Yang-Mills theory); spontaneous symmetry breaking: Goldstone and Higgs bosons. Elementary QCD and standard model and beyond; running coupling constant; Grand Unified Theories(GUTs); minimal SU(5), SO(10). Neutrinos: Weyl, Majorana and Dirac representations of fermions. The two-component neutrino theory. Massive neutrinos, Beta-decay (mass of neutrino), Double beta decay (effective mass of electron neutrino), pion decay, muon decay, muon neutrino, tau neutrino, neutrino oscillations (reactor and atmospheric), SUSY, compositeness, cosmic neutrino background and dark matter.
