Some topics and modules are completely new. However the approach is quite different from JEE and looks at the subject in a very different perspective. The basic and complete syllabus is defined by the slides provided by the Profs and is your main study materials. Do attend classes if attendance is taken especially Organic and Inorganic because the questions asked in exams are quite different and requires the skills and concepts taught in class.\nPrevious years practice papers are a must as questions are repeated quite often but don't expect anything about the paper as it might turn the other way round which had happened in Autumn Sem where quite lengthy and involving numericals were asked which required application of multiple formulae and concepts. No theory based descriptive questions are asked except 1-2 from Inorganic section.\nOnline and offline class tests will be taken: 6 marks Physical, 7+7 marks for Inorganic and Organic.\nMust attend tutorials of Organic (you will realise the reason quite soon :) )", "page": "CY11001: Chemistry"}, {"chunk_id": "d3e86f83", "title": "Additional Resources", "text": "Instiinfo Repository", "page": "CY11001: Chemistry"}]
