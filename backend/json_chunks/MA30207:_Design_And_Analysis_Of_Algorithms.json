Prof. Sourav Mukhopadhyay is a genuinely helpful professor, who has no qualms in repeating each topic multiple times till one understands it. Final opinion - Take this course as an additional only if you want to get done with the least effort put in. Otherwise, would recommend Algorithms-I any day.", "page": "MA30207: Design And Analysis Of Algorithms"}, {"chunk_id": "f24486a0", "title": "How to Crack the Paper", "text": "Most questions in the mid-semesters and end-semesters are repeated from previous year papers, so having a look at those is recommended.
