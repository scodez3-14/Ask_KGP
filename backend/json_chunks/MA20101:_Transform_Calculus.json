This course don't have very much concepts rather you need a decent practice to grab the topic properly. Also you need to remember a good amount of theorems and formulas which you should be able to apply at proper place.\nDuring the course, if you want to study from books. Then it is strongly recommended that you follow only one book because you may find different conventions for Fourier transform, Inverse Fourier transform,Fourier Sine transform,Inverse Fourier Sine transform etc. in different books.This thing can even effect the answer of some questions. Therefore follow the convention from one book and practice accordingly.", "page": "MA20101: Transform Calculus"}, {"chunk_id": "4bdc8215", "title": "How to Crack the Paper", "text": "For exam, firstly you should practice class problems well. After that you can practice more questions from tutorials.If you do these two things properly and have clarity in your concepts, then your job is done.It is more than sufficient to score good marks in this course and you even don't need to study any book.\nDuring the exam, mention clearly your convention for Fourier transform, Inverse Fourier transform,Fourier Sine transform,Inverse Fourier Sine transform etc. before solving any question.", "page": "MA20101: Transform Calculus"}, {"chunk_id": "273fefec", "title": "Additional Resources", "text": "14ME Batch Course Repository", "page": "MA20101: Transform Calculus"}, {"chunk_id": "24582d3d", "title": "Time Table", "text": "Day | 8:00-8:55 am | 9:00-9:55 am | 10:00-10:55 am | 11:00-11:55 am | 12:00-12:55 pm | 2:00-2:55 pm | 3:00-3:55 pm | 4:00-4:55 pm | 5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday | NR422,NR321,NR421,NR322 | NR422,NR321,NR421,NR322\nTuesday | NR422,NR321,NR421,NR322\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday", "page": "MA20101: Transform Calculus"}]
