It starts by talking about Embedded systems and different State Machines with real-life examples. The professors are excellent in their teaching and they are always ready to clarify the doubts even by taking extra classes. t was taught by Ayantika Chatterjee and Arnab Sarkar . The course was very interesting and i was never bored to attend a class.", "page": "AT60003: Embedded Software Design %26 Validation"}, {"chunk_id": "f2650c28", "title": "How to Crack the Paper", "text": "Just following the slides and completing the assignments is more than enough.
