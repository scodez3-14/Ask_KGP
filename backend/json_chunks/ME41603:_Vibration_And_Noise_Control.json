You need to regularly understand.\nSir teaches quite well and is patient with doubts. So ask away.\nActually understanding is optional if you can memorize/solve similar stuff to whatever is done in class.\nEverything in exam is from class notes only and only and only. So that's most important.\nYou'll find it extremely difficult to find any online or any other resources. No need to do previous year papers. Just mug class notes thoroughly.\nSome fast calculation helps, but anirvan dasgupta sir is chill about it.", "page": "ME41603: Vibration And Noise Control"}]
