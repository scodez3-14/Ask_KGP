GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a programming project under the guidance of mentors. Stipends of upto US$3,000 (as of 2023) are awarded to students who successfully complete a proposed free and open-source software development project during the summer. Google has introduced multiple sized projects ( 90 , 175 and 350 hours).

[ 3 ]\nDuring the the period of 2005-2012 IIT Kharagpur had produced the highest number (51) of GSoCers from India [ 4 ] , and by 2016 there have been 92 GSoCers from IIT Kharagpur [ 5 ] .

Often mentoring organisations have their own application templates which typically asks the student to give biographical information, details of the project and a timeline.

However, from 2017, Stipends are adjusted based on country ($2,400 for India) and are paid in three parts, one after each successful evaluation. [ 8 ] .

No money is given should one fail the evaluations, miss the deadlines or withdraw from the program.\nAs of 2024, Indian students get a stipend of $750 (for small sized projects), $1500 (for medium sized projects) or $3000 (for large sized projects) in two stages:\n\u2022 Mid Evaluation: (Mid July) - 45%\n\u2022 End Evaluation (Early September) - 55%", "page": "Google Summer of Code"}, {"chunk_id": "0f8a269f", "title": "Resources", "text": "FLOSS Manuals has a detailed manual about Google Summer of Code which includes sample student proposals.
