[{"chunk_id": "d7ff4d04", "title": "Introduction - Why IPFS", "text": "Sometimes, users might required to add PDF files in a wiki article. But files generally consume a lot of space on the server. Hence, a simpler solution would be to upload the PDF somewhere and put its reference link in the article. General solution might be to upload a PDF in one's cloud storage accounts like Google Drive or Dropbox. But there are chances that in future the link to the file may be broken due to reasons like user's account getting banned or user deleting the file accidentally. So, it is necessary to have a place, where the PDF is uploaded permanently, and link is valid forever.\nIPFS [ 1 ] solves our problems here. IPFS is a peer to peer file storage system. A file uploaded in IPFS cannot be deleted [ 2 ] . So, the link in the article will never be broken.
