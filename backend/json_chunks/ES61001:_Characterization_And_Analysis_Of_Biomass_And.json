The main objective of this course is tofamiliarize the students with the latest sophisticated analytical toolsused for the characterization of biomass and biofuel which play acrucial role in bioenergy production. This elective course can be takenby the graduate and undergraduate students.b) Contents (in 100 to 150 words) : Analysis of biomass and biofuel quality plays an important role inbiofuel research. This course will help PG students/Research scholarsto acquire state of the art knowledge of analysis, characterizationtechniques and their interpretations with regards to biofuelsproduction.II.Introduction: Biomass, diversity, sources, availability etc.Constitutional analysis of biomass: Qualitative and quantitativeProximate and ultimate analysis of biomass.Biochemical analysis using analytical tools: Total carbon, total organiccarbon, protein, nitrogen, carbohydrate (Starch, cellulose,hemicellulose), lipid, total sugar, reducing sugar, non-reducing sugar,pectin and fibre, determination of lignin and its derivatives,determination of organic and inorganic elements which include C, H,N, S, P, K, macro and micronutrient analysis Toxicity test of thebiomass.Analysis of liquid bio-fuel such as bio-ethanol, bio-butanol, bioalkane,bioalkenes, biodiesel etc.Analysis of different constituents and contaminants present in thetargeted product.Analysis of recovered biomass: Microscopic and spectroscopic studiesfor structural analysis and its interpretation, pore size determination,3D microstructure analysisAnalysis of gaseous bio-fuel: Determination of CH4, CO2, CO, H2S,H2 in biogasDetermination of volatile fatty acid (VFA) and its constituents,alkalinity (Total and partial), biological oxygen demand (BOD),Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and conversion efficiencyAnalysis of syngas and compressed gas.Analysis of fuel qualities/properties: Bomb calorimeter,Junker\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s calorimeter, Flash point, pour point, viscosity,kinematic viscosity, acid value, saponification, fatty acid composition,iodine value, cetane index, octane value, oxidatIII.Recommended Text Books : 1.
