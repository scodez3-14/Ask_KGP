Moreover, the prof isn't much interested to teach you more than basics.\nThis is a very light course. Attending the classes will help the beginners to get through the softwares and learn the basics and get their hands on it while it is very trivial thing for those who have used them before.", "page": "AR23206: Computer Aided Design And Simulation"}, {"chunk_id": "82643676", "title": "How to Crack the Paper", "text": "Depends on the mood of the prof, he may or may not take a viva for final marking.
