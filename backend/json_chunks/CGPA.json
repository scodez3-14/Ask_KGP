The SGPA will be calculated as follows: CGPA = (\u03a3 i=1 m c i g i ) / (\u03a3 m i=1 c i ) where \u2018m\u2019 is the number of subjects registered and cleared for the semester, \u2018c i \u2019 is the number of Credits allotted to a particular subject, and \u2018g i \u2019 is the grade points carried by the letter corresponding to the grade awarded to the student for the subject. SGPA will be rounded off to the second place of decimal and recorded as such.

CGPA will be rounded off to the second place of decimal and recorded as such.\n\u2022 From 2022, Percetange of Marks = 20/7 (4*CGPA - 5) [ 2 ] . Prior to this, the formula Percentage of Marks = CGPA * 10 [ 1 ] was used.\n\u2022 When a student gets the grade \u2018F\u2019 in any subject during a semester, the SGPA and the CGPA from that semester onwards will be tentatively calculated, taking only \u2018zero points\u2019 for each such \u2018F\u2019 grade. After the \u2018F\u2019 grade(s) has/have been substituted by better grades during a subsequent semester, the SGPA and the CGPA of all the semesters, starting from the earliest semester in which the \u2018F\u2019 grade has been updated, will be recomputed and recorded to take this change of grade into account.", "page": "CGPA"}, {"chunk_id": "c433ae93", "title": "How to Calculate CGPA Result?", "text": "CGPA result is the sum of results of more than one semester or year. GPA results of multiple semesters or years are divided together to show a single result and that is the CGPA result.
