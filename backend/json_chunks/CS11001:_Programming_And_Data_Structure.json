Only the syntactical part will change.\nIf you haven't, it is high time that you learn C programming in your vacations (Winter and Summer). The following channels may help you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWliApDc61w&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwLSqGsERZGXGkA5AfMhcknE , https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS8ACsmFCpmSZQv44y56AviLUbvyriVYh .\nThe course is high paced because it's quite natural that a 2 year course is compressed into a 40 hour lecture series.\nHowever , the question paper is not that easy (even for experienced students because of certain nitty-gritties involved). So practise as much as you can. And there is a PDS Doubt Session orgainised by SWG IIT Kharagpur.
