Later on 7th August, Shovan Panigrahi (VP TSG 2016-2017) sent an email to students informing them about \"Election Regulation Cell\" which found Devanand Kedia's credential about instiinfo incorrect. [ 2 ] Awaaz IIT Kharagpur raised questions about the timing of the of the email and the verification process. [ 3 ] The co-founders of instiinfo.com claimed in a video that Devanand Kedia was also a co-founder. [ 4 ] The 5 mentioned co-founders, although were friends in their first year, when the website was launched at the beginning of the next semester, it only mentioned 4 co-founders. A reddit user put together some more evidence denying Devanand Kedia as one of the founders, claiming there were only 4 founders to begin with.
