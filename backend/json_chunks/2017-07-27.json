A long discussion ensued on the same, and the following was decided:\n\u2022 A course review system should be in place where students can leave their reviews and ratings for each course. To start with, Arun Patro will be creating a google form through which volunteers from the group can each fill reviews for at least 5 courses from their department. This reviews will eventually be channelled back to the Wiki manually. This could prove as a starting point for future contributors to leave reviews.\n\u2022 Ayush Goyal will be working on a portal through which students can upload notes for a course (which will be uploaded to archive.org). These notes will be linked on the course page. A future addition to this could be a way to leave a rating on these notes so as to sort them by rating later on.", "page": "2017-07-27"}, {"chunk_id": "04e87b0e", "title": "The state of 'The dashboard'", "text": "A dashboard was created by 4 members from MetaKGP during Inter-IIT Tech Meet at IIT Kanpur.
