Complex structures and processes, collective phenomena: broken symmetry , Landau Fermi liquid, correlated Fermi and Bose systems, Kondo effect, mixed valence systems, heavy fermions, metal-insulator transitions, Mott transition, itinerant electron magnetism, superconductivity, high temperature superconductors, Tomonaga-Luttinger model, quantum Hall effect- integer and fractional. Quantum disorder, localization. Quantum spin systems, exchange, ferro and antiferromagnetic states, excitations, double exchange systems, spin glass. \"Seeing quantum mechanics:\" physics at nanoscale. Basic notions of soft condensed matter: liquid crystals, membranes and polymers, Landau theory , density functional theory, simple biological systems. Applications of condensed matter physics to biology.", "page": "PH58006: A View Of Condensed Matter Physics"}]
