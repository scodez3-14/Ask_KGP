Someone with less calculation speed and who has the habit of making calculation errors is going to suffer. However this can be avoided by practicing regularly. The problems are almost the same every year but still one needs to learn everything.The best way to performance in this is to understand the concepts clearly and practice regularly.", "page": "MA20102: Numerical Solution Of Ordinary And Pde"}, {"chunk_id": "f2aa59e5", "title": "Classroom resources", "text": "Numerical Solutions to Differential Equations - MK Jain", "page": "MA20102: Numerical Solution Of Ordinary And Pde"}]
