This student group has conceived and bred the first and the only fest in India that is solely dedicated to Space Technology - National Students\u2019 Space Challenge (NSSC).\nNSSC saw the light of day in 2011 when it saw a prolific response from all over India in its very first year. In 2012 the fest witnessed an exponential growth in student participation. And from then, NSSC grew to both in popularity and diversity. The fest primarily focuses on giving hand on experience to the students in solving real time technological problems faced in exploring the far reaches of Space and also conducts workshops to guide the present generation. The Fest organises multiple Technology applied competitions - varying from robotics, machinery, rocketry science to data applications; various workshops like on the field of airplane design, satellite construction, observational astronomy and others; several presentations and case study events; quiz event and other Astronomy related events; along with Guest Lectures and Webinars from prominent personalities from Space organisations and Universities in India and abroad.\nVisit the official site at http://nssc.in", "page": "NSSC"}, {"chunk_id": "7b0a3997", "title": "Mission", "text": "NSSC primarily motives on inculcating a culture of Space Technology, inspiring and promoting research in space applications, technology, astronomy, astrophysics and related fields; and broadening the horizons of the student community to cosmic research by interacting with eminent scientists, professionals and technicians working in Space Application and Research based Organisations throughout the world.
