Next morning, he had to re-visit the hospital because his conditions had gone worse and he was in severe pain. He was then sent back home with some prescribed painkillers. Unfortunately, while going back to his hostel he collapsed and his head hit a cow-trap. He was immediately taken back to the hospital where he waited around 3 hours to get an appointment with a doctor. After his arrival, the doctor without any treatment, referred him to Apollo Hospital, Kolkata stating that he needed a neurologist.
