It requires heavy to super heavy effort. The concept is relatively easy to understand. The challenge is to solve the questions. Practice solving questions using both EES and the tables. The exam will involve the usage of heavy interpolations. So, dexterity in the usage of calculators is a must.\nLot of new concepts are taught which are practically applicable. This is a very important course.", "page": "ME22002: Thermodynamics"}, {"chunk_id": "f53c524c", "title": "How to Crack the Paper", "text": "Book to refer: Fundamentals of Thermodynamics Slides by prof.S Mitra The above to resources are very good.
