After installation, instructions for updating and upgrading ubuntu should be given. Never mess with disk partitions unless you know what you are doing. Installation instructions for other Distros are very similar. Be sure to check that you are installing alongside Windows and not removing everything from your disk. Be sure to check the hashsums of the file downloaded and the corresponding hash values given on their website before installation. Both the values should match. You can use freely available Hashcalc for Windows.
