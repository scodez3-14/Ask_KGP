It is a non-immigrant, temporary visa issued to trainees or interns for a fixed period of time. If you are currently studying and are accepted by an institution or company in United States for summer, J1 is the most appropriate visa type for you. J1 visa requires a government authorized sponsor agency. A sponsor agency is simply a third-party organization which will handle all the documents and necessary paperwork for your visa at some cost. Typically, your host institution itself (if a major university) will be a sponsor, otherwise would advise you to contact a different sponsor. The overall visa process, depending on your type, might take anywhere between 1 to 3 months.\nThe first step is to get in touch with a sponsor organization. The HR manager of your host institution will have specific advise on this matter. Once you have a sponsor ready to handle your application, the following steps follow:\n\u2022 Obtain the invitation letter from your institution.\n\u2022 Complete Trainee/Intern Agreement (TIA) and Trainee/Intern Placement Plan (TIPP) agreements. Your sponsor may request additional documents like bonafide certicate and resume.\n\u2022 Your sponsor organization's coordinator or your inviting faculty will schedule an interview to fill your SEVIS record.\n\u2022 Sign the agreements as necessary.\n\u2022 The sponsor will process your DS2019 form and send to you by post. The mail will also contain additional documents like a signed TIPP plan (also called DS 7002 form ), a social security application letter and other documents (insurance, for example).\n\u2022 Complete online DS160 form , pay SEVIS fee using the details provided by your sponsor.

One can apply for an F1 visa after getting an official acceptance/invitation letter and the I-20 form from a US university approved by SEVP (Student and Exchange Visitor Program). The I-20 form you receive will contain all the required information for starting your visa application i.e. SEVIS ID; school name, code, address and official contact; course and duration of study; estimated costs and funding source(s).\nThe F1 visa application process is quite similar to that of J1 visa and is relatively easier to get. The only difference is that in case of F1, you will receive I-20 form from the concerned university instead of DS2019 form. Students accepted for a doctorate program may get a DS2019 form or I-20 form from the university, depending on the nature of program and slots available for J1 visas in the university. In that case, it is best for the student to get in touch with the OIS (Office of International Services) of the university and figure out what type of visa will be much more suitable and relevant. The first step is to obtain the official admissions offer letter and I-20 form from the university or research institute/centre. If the university is fully or partially funding your tuition fees and living expenses, that will be mentioned in your offer letter and I-20 form. In case, funding is arranged from personal resources or third party organization, the same should be notified to the university after you accept the offer with required documents as per university guidelines\n\u2022 After you obtain the form, you need to pay the SEVIS fees (generally known as I-901 fee). The present fee is 200$ and payable online only through credit card. After payment, obtain and take a printout of SEVIS I-901 payment confirmation slip. Please note that it might take 2-3 working days for your payment to be processed and acknowledged\n\u2022 You need to fill up the DS-160 form before paying the visa appointment fees and making an appointment.
