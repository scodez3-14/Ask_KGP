What's new is the restricted way of solving. There exists a particular way of solving every question as directed by the professor which has to be strictly maintained. Preparation is easy, but the final result depends more on the efficiency of your calculations and how quick you solve each question. Because this course has one of the lengthiest papers of what iit kgp has to offer.", "page": "CH21103: Chemical Process Calculations"}, {"chunk_id": "1ca64581", "title": "Time Table", "text": "Day | 8:00-8:55 am | 9:00-9:55 am | 10:00-10:55 am | 11:00-11:55 am | 12:00-12:55 pm | 2:00-2:55 pm | 3:00-3:55 pm | 4:00-4:55 pm | 5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday | NC141\nTuesday | NC141 | NC141\nWednesday\nThursday | NC141\nFriday", "page": "CH21103: Chemical Process Calculations"}]
