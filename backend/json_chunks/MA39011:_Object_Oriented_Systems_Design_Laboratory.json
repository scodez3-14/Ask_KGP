In total, teaches you next to nothing but expects you to code everything (The theory classes are in C++ but you are expected to code in JAVA). End evaluation would be based on printed codes of the programs and would deduce marks on a malformed index. Would ask you to create diagrams of class structure (though this is actually a good thing to learn, maybe this is the only takeaway from the course). In the viva, would ask you random questions. No one got EX, two-three students got A. But the lab is peaceful, there is not much load.
