Harry, who was unwell at that time, took some time to open the door. This infuriated the seniors and they wanted to drag Harry to the sports trials, despite the fact that he was unwell.\nMeanwhile, another third-year student named Tommy came rushing, repeatedly shouting at Harry at the top of his voice. In irritation, Harry uttered an abusive word. In retaliation, Tommy tightly slapped him twice. Then, he choked Harry against the wall and slapped him a few more times. This left scratches and bruises on the victim.\nThe investigation into this case is still in progress. There is a common perception that this is a fairly simple case of ragging with several witnesses and enough proof backing this version of events.", "page": "Incident of Ragging in IIT Kharagpur"}]
