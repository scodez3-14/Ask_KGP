The problem statement came from a company called Abzooba and had three sub-parts. The first one was to create a recommender system from a data of search query by a user on an e-commerce, the resulting product shown and the feedback given by the user. The second problem statement was to rank a set of documents based on a search query. The third was a link to a problem on Kaggle, which had already been closed and its solutions were available. The first problem came with a small dataset of 81 entries and there was no data given for the second one. The sub committee meeting unanimously decided to scrape the third problem statement. Since getting people to do grunt work is not a hard task some halls pointed out that the first and second problem statement can be solved by manually ranking document and giving the feedback on the queries. The committee decided to have a Skype meeting with the problems setters and simultaneously pursue other companies for additional problem statements. The VoIP meeting never happened and there was some confusion regarding fact if the sub problem statement one has been scrapped. The next subcommittee meeting, after a long debate decided to scrape both the remaining problem statements. After this, Gymkhana representatives contacted the next company on the priority list \u2018Absolute Data\u2019 with some guidelines decided by all the halls to avoid the complications in the Problem Statement but due to large no. of guidelines, company was not able to give the Problem Statement in required time scale. Meanwhile, Gymkhana told that they already had a Problem Statement from Abzooba which came for Open IIT and it was closed till now. Then after waiting for 3 days, on 18th January all halls decided to release the Problem Statement from Abzooba. This time problem statement (Predicting Demographic Information of a Facebook User with Specified Degree of Uncertainty) was very good but again the only problem was no data. Each hall sent some queries regarding problem statement and we got the reply this time but it was too vague to work on. The company refused to sent any data. Again, all halls agreed to scrap the problem statement.\nThe next problem statement came from a company called Quanta, it was expected that Quanta will give a \"good\" problem statement because it was the problem setter for the event of 2014-2015. The problem statement was to rate the vendors of Flipkart or Amazon. In further clarifications the company clarified that they have no data, no judging criteria, no testing data or accuracy criteria. They said the submissions will be judged only on the \"soundness\" of the model given in the submitted report.", "page": "Data Analytics (GC)"}, {"chunk_id": "2aff55a8", "title": "2014-2015: Electricity Theft Detection", "text": "The problem statement for 2014 was to detect possible fraudulent customers given the data collected by a power distribution company.
