Typically, most universities have cutoff varying between 80-100. There are hardly any universities that require scoring above 100 as cutoff. So, any score above 100 is pretty good. In fact, scoring above 110 will put in 90-percentile group. Also, unlike GRE, TOEFL requires you to select target universities before giving the test. You are required to fill in the codes of universities for which you will be sending the scores by 10 p.m (local time) of the previous day of the test date. By doing so you will get an opportunity to send scores for free to 4 universities. After 10 p.m there will be late charges. More info can be found . Make sure you have selected your target universities before taking the exam.\nThe most important thing about scores, is the score in speaking section. Generally all the good universities will offer you a Teaching Assistantship (TA) if and only if you have a speaking score of more than or equal to 27 ( generally most of the Indians get stuck up in the range 22 to 26) . So getting a good score in speaking section and having reasonably good grades will give you an edge over other applicants in funding. Of course there are other forms of assistantship's like fellowships and Research Assistantships (RA) which you will get based on the strength and content your application. Lastly there should be no much of a worry if one cannot score the threshold in speaking. Having an overall good score will also give an equal advantage, but one will have to clear an exam similar to TOEFL(designed according to the universities teaching standards) after getting an admission. Generally these tests will happen in the orientation week of the graduate school and are very easy compared to TOEFL.", "page": "How to prepare for TOEFL"}, {"chunk_id": "417250c7", "title": "See also", "text": "\u2022 How to prepare for GRE\n\u2022 How to apply to graduate school", "page": "How to prepare for TOEFL"}, {"chunk_id": "7cbd9813", "title": "External Links", "text": "\u2022 TOEFL Sample Questions\n\u2022 TOEFL Test Preparation: The Insider\u2019s Guide\n\u2022 TOEFL Mock Tests", "page": "How to prepare for TOEFL"}]
