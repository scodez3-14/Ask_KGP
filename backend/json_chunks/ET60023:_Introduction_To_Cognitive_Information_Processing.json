Go ahead! A peaceful course with less workload.\nBut if you are interested in learning about cognitive science via this course, DON'T TAKE IT. Course contains shallow discussions, biased examples, naive explanations for a lot of things. That is not the way psychology should be taught or learnt.\nInstead try the following courses if you are interested about human brain\n\u2022 HS20002 General Psychology : Introduction to General Psychology. Basics of Psychology are discussed. Interesting things can be learnt about human behaviour.\n\u2022 EC60007: Computational Neuroscience : Understanding brain from a computational and mathematical point of view.", "page": "ET60023: Introduction To Cognitive Information Processing"}, {"chunk_id": "a15dcba3", "title": "Time Table", "text": "Check the ERP Slot.
