Can learn a lot of good mathematics, if taught by a good professor.\nIf taught by AA, don't take. Not so good teaching. But by daily attending classes and a bit of self study, you can learn things. Choice is yours. If the prof is good, then it is a good course to learn mathematics.", "page": "ME60413: Continuum Mechanics"}]
