Evapotranspiration: governing factors, potential vs actual evapotranspiration, estimation and measurements, role in soil water budgetInfiltration: soil water balance, factors determining infiltration rates, porosity, saturation, and soil water content, field capacity and capillary action, estimating infiltration rates, artificial infiltration methods,Groundwater transport: Flow characterization, groundwater storage and extraction.Surface Water and Groundwater Flow: Characteristics of fluid flow, critical, subcritical and supercritical flows, open channel and pipe flow, major and minor head losses, friction factors, hydraulic jump, flood propagation, stage-discharge relations for open channels, groundwater hydraulics, drawdown discharge relations for confined and unconfined aquifers, steady and unsteady flow into wells, Dupuit approximations, single and multiwell system, well interferences, well losses.Human Interventions on Hydrologic Cycle: Impacts on water quantity and quality, groundwater vulnerability, impacts of flow controls in natural streams, groundwater extraction and artificial recharge, crop practices and irrigation, waste disposal, rainwater harvesting, effect of climate change, local, regional and global extent of issues, quantitative estimation of effects, flow-net modelling, prediction and solute transport and attenuation. Prevention and Remedial Measures: Need of holistic planning approach, groundwater protection and clean-up, restoration of lakes, streams and aquifers, storm water management, improvements of water supply systems and integrated waste management, rain gardens, soil conversation, efficient and optimum irrigation adaptation etc., relevant case studies.", "page": "WM60007: Environmental Hydrology And Hydraulics"}, {"chunk_id": "4811af5c", "title": "Time Table", "text": "Day | 8:00-8:55 am | 9:00-9:55 am | 10:00-10:55 am | 11:00-11:55 am | 12:00-12:55 pm | 2:00-2:55 pm | 3:00-3:55 pm | 4:00-4:55 pm | 5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday | NC444\nThursday | NC444\nFriday | NC444 | NC444", "page": "WM60007: Environmental Hydrology And Hydraulics"}]
