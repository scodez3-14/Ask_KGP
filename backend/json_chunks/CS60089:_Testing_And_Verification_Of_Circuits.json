Fault equivalence and dominance; fault collapsing. Fault simulation: parallel, deductive and concurrent techniques; critical path tracing. Test generation for combinational circuits: Boolean difference, D-algorithm, Podem, etc. Exhaustive, random and weighted test pattern generation; aliasing and its effect on fault coverage. PLA testing: cross-point fault model, test generation, easily testable designs. Memory testing: permanent, intermittent and pattern-sensitive faults; test generation. Delay faults and hazards; test generation techniques. Test pattern generation for sequential circuits: ad-hoc and structures techniques, scan path and LSSD, boundary scan. Built-in self-test techniques. Verification: logic level (combinational and sequential circuits), RTL-level (data path and control path). Verification of embedded systems. Use of formal techniques: decision diagrams, logic-based approaches.", "page": "CS60089: Testing And Verification Of Circuits"}, {"chunk_id": "a85eba9f", "title": "Time Table", "text": "Day | 8:00-8:55 am | 9:00-9:55 am | 10:00-10:55 am | 11:00-11:55 am | 12:00-12:55 pm | 2:00-2:55 pm | 3:00-3:55 pm | 4:00-4:55 pm | 5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday | CSE-120\nThursday | CSE-120\nFriday | CSE-120 | CSE-120", "page": "CS60089: Testing And Verification Of Circuits"}]
