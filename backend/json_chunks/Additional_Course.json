A student would be allowed to register in an additional subject only if he/she satisfies the pre-requisite, there is no clash in the timetable and the class size permits.\n\u2022 Once a student has registered in an additional subject, the grade obtained (including F-grade) in that subject would invariably be recorded in his/her grade card. The credit contribution of these additional subjects to the computation of CGPA, however, would be considered as nil.\n\u2022 The GPA of the additional subjects is separately calculated and indicated in the grade card.\n\u2022 A student can drop an additional subject following the proper procedure within 3(three) weeks from the commencement of the semester; otherwise, the subject will remain registered and the subject will be mandatorily reflected on the Grade Card even with F grade.\n\u2022 There is no scope for a supplementary examination in an additional subject.\n\u2022 Student can get Minor from other departments by completing required number of credits and full filling the requirements.", "page": "Additional Course"}, {"chunk_id": "33262913", "title": "Micro Credits", "text": "Micro-Credit courses are one credit courses having duration of 3\u201014 days offered during the semester or during evening or free slots available during weekdays or even weekends that are not declared holidays in some special cases when students are available.\n\u2022 The subject will be counted for total credit requirement for completion of degree in special cases subject to recommendation of the Head and approval of Dean (UGS) with due reasons recorded.\n\u2022 The subject and grade will be mentioned in transcript / grade card and will be used to compute CGPA for additional subjects and will be shown as ACGPA. Failures will be marked by F grade. There will be no supplementary examination for such subjects. The F grade will be changed only if the subject is offered again and the student is allowed to register and clear the subject. However, in case the micro-credit is accepted as a subject contributing to the curricular requirement, it will be accounted for in the CGPA calculations.\n\u2022 A student is normally not expected to take more than 2 such courses in a semester.
