Over the years, the department has built up laboratories in the areas of aerodynamics, structures and propulsion. A Centre of Excellence for Composite Structures Technology, funded by ARDB, has been established in 1999. Some major thrust areas of the future are Aerospace Control Systems, Aero-Servo-Elasticity, Aerothermo-Mechanics, Industrial Aerodynamics, Air Breathing Propulsion, Composites, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Non-destructive testing and Wind Energy. Currently, the research efforts of the faculty are supported by a large number of projects sponsored by ARDB, ADA, ISRO, DST, AICTE, MHRD and many other organisations", "page": "Aero"}, {"chunk_id": "b5fcec0c", "title": "Research Areas", "text": "Smart and Composite Structures\nUncertainty Quantification in Aircraft Analysis & Design\nJet controls.\nAerospace structures\nNonlocal elasticity\nFEM\nFGM\nSmart Structures\nComposite materials and nano-composites\nOptimization\nFGM Plates and Shells\nComposite and Smart Structures\nStructural Dynamics & Aeroelasticity\nDesign & Development of MR fluid damper & Landing Gear Dynamics\nStructural Health Monitoring\nComposite Structures\nMicro Air Vehicle\nComputational Aerodynamics Experimental Aerodynamics\nFluid Mechanics\nAerodynamics\nAeroacoustics\nLarge Eddy Simulation\nFluid-Structure Interaction\nComputational fluid dynamics and flight mechanics\nFlight Dynamics Controls System-Identification Neural Networks\nCombustion and propulsion\nFault Detection and Isolation\nGlobal Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)\nCombustion of Solid Fuels and Energetic Particles\nPath Planning of Autonomous Vehicles\nDroplet and Spray Combustion\nExperimental Methods in Combustion\nAtomization and Sprays\nSystem Identification/Parameter Estimation - Neural Networks\nFlight Dynamics & Control and Flight Testing\nDesign Guidance and Control of Rockets Parafoil UAV MAV WIG-Craft etc.\nNumerical simulation of compressible and chemically reacting flows\nCombustion Driven Shock Tunnel\nLaser spectroscopy (new field)\nTwo-Phase Flow Computations\nDNS\nLES\nCompressible turbulence\nTurbulence-radiation interaction\nTurbulent reacting flows\nhigh performance computing\nSolid Mechanics\nHydrodynamics.\nAero-acoustics.\nShock-Boundary Layer Interactions.\nRadiative heat transfer\nCombustion\nTrajectory Optimization\nDubins Vehicle\nObstacle Avoidance\nTurbomachines\nGas turbine\nEstimation Theory\nUAV", "page": "Aero"}]
