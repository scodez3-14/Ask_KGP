Complex structures and processes, collective phenomena: broken symmetry , Landau Fermi liquid, correlated Fermi and Bose systems, Kondo effect, mixed valence systems, heavy fermions, metal-insulator transitions, Mott transition, itinerant electron magnetism, superconductivity, high temperature superconductors, Tomonaga-Luttinger model, quantum Hall effect- integer and fractional. Quantum disorder, localization. Quantum spin systems, exchange, ferro and antiferromagnetic states, excitations, double exchange systems, spin glass. (Seeing quantum mechanics) physics at nanoscale. Basic notions of soft condensed matter: liquid crystals, membranes and polymers, Landau theory , density functional theory, simple biological systems. Applications of condensed matter physics to biology.", "page": "PH60104: A View Of Condensed Matter Physics - Modern Concepts"}]
