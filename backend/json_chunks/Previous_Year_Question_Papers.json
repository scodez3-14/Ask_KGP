[{"chunk_id": "bbcd8e03", "title": "Previous Year Question Papers", "text": "Previous year question papers are central to anyone's preparation during semester examinations. For this, a number of official and student compiled resources exist.\nOfficially, the website of central library hosts a collection of the previous year question papers called PEQP . The site is locally hosted and can be visited only from inside the institute. Any proxy settings must be bypassed for this site, or turned off entirely. The website, however, suffers from a number of issues - the collection is far from complete, not too many people can open the link at a time etc.,\nTo alleviate the situation, alternative tools have been created:\n\u2022 IQPS - Quick search the library's question papers database by course name, year, or semester. Works even when library website is down and students can upload their scanned question papers at IQPS for future batches.\n\u2022 MFQP (Deprecated) - Predecessor of IQPS.", "page": "Previous Year Question Papers"}]
