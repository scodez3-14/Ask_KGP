Some questions are made challenging (even in paper) but with practice and concentration they could become easier to solve. Its okay, even if you solve half the assignment.\n\u2022 Consider a brief revision of basic Linear Algebra concepts mainly proofs, results, and applications.\n\u2022 Aim more on learning than on getting grades.", "page": "MA60053: Computational Linear Algebra"}]
