So if you are in your 5th sem, buckle up, because a: you will not go the classes for this subject, and b: because of a, you will have to study from the notes of that one guy in your batch who will religiously attend all the classes but his notes will be on rather unorganized, chaotic, and random side of the notes' quality spectrum.
