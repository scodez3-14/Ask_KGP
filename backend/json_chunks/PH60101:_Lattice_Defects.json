Estimation of lattice defects - kinematical and dynamical theory of diffraction, contrasts in micrography and topography, techniques of defect estimation, SEM, TEM , STM , LEED . Analytical approach - diffraction profile analysis , diffuse scattering , anomalous transmission and Borrmann effect. Effect of lattice defects on properties of materials- strength, electrical and magnetic behavior, dynamic correlation. Controlling lattice defects - cold working , quenching , annealing and other mechanical and thermal treatments.", "page": "PH60101: Lattice Defects"}]
