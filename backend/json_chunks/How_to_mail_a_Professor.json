[{"chunk_id": "d05ccae9", "title": "How to mail a Professor", "text": "This page outlines some common sense etiquette that professors expect a student to maintain while mailing them. These were written with IIT Kharagpur students in mind. But other students may benefit from these as well.\nThe points below are abridged from Advice to students on writing emails \u2013 Jeevanjyoti Chakraborty's Blog\nStart with a proper address. The formal, idiomatic way is to start with \u201cDear Professor Surname-of-the-Professor\u201d. You may also write \u201cDear Dr Surname-of-the-faculty\u201d. Please do NOT write things like \u201cDear Dr John\u201d. That\u2019s very unidiomatic. It should be \u201cDear Dr Smith\u201d.\n\u2022 If you are writing to a lady faculty member or anyways referring to a lady faculty member, it is STILL \u201cProfessor Surname-of-the-faculty\u201d or \u201cDr Surname-of-the-faculty\u201d. NEVER EVER (ABSOLUTELY EVER!) write \u201cMiss\u201d, \u201cMs\u201d or \u201cMrs\u201d.\n\u2022 Greetings like \u201cDear Jeevan Sir\u201d can be excused if you know the professor being mailed to very well. And, overall that\u2019s fine as long as you are at IIT Kharagpur. But, please make sure that don\u2019t write like this to people with whom you are not on close terms. And, stop doing this once you are out of IIT Kharagpur!\n\u2022 EXTREMELY important point: In the body of the email, first of all, introduce yourself with your name and roll number. At the end of the email body, again write your name and roll number.\n\u2022 When you are making a request, you need to be polite. \u201cPlease could you \u2026\u201d or \u201cKindly take a look into \u2026\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d be grateful if you kindly consider \u2026 \u201d. Never write in a way that makes your email appear as if you are ordering; for example, \u201cDo the subject registration for me\u201d or \u201cOpen that elective option for me\u201d The above point regarding politely making your request applies not just when you are writing to faculty members. WHENEVER you are making a request \u2013 even if it is to one of your friends or juniors \u2013 you need to make the request politely.\n\u2022 At the same time, when being polite, please don\u2019t overdo it! The actual content of your email or the actual request should not get buried under a mountain of supplicatory phrases! Make your email sound polite but crisp and professional.\n\u2022 When you think you have to explain a complicated situation, first try to think it out and then write as concisely as possible. A shorter email has a greater chance of actually being read through and being acted upon.\n\u2022 If the situation is such that you do indeed have to describe the details, please do NOT write one large paragraph. Break it up into readable chunks.\n\u2022 DO NOT use mail trackers. Apart from being considered a violation of privacy, many people hate this kind of intrusive behaviour. In the worst-case scenario, it induces stubbornness in people to not reply BECAUSE you used the mail tracker \u2013 so the whole idea backfires.\n\u2022 Sometimes you will see emails from some faculty members which sound extremely rude. Please do not take those instances as examples to follow. Reject the bad and learn from the good instances.", "page": "How to mail a Professor"}]
