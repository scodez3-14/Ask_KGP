Unfortunately, some of us are not able to devote time for illumination due to other acads and co-curricular activities. Here are some tips to escape illu-duty and consequences with each step. ( Note that these may vary depending to the hall)\n\u2022 Simplest tip, go to library/maggu room, a lab/study room in your department. But its not that simple.
