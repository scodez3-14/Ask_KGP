The way the professor teaches makes it very easy for anyone to understand quantum physics. The lab classes on every Monday for an hour are very informative. Grading is relative. Overall there is a lot you can learn on this course.", "page": "MT41028: Atomistic Modelling Of Materials"}, {"chunk_id": "23fb5c95", "title": "How to Crack the Paper", "text": "Attending classes will be really helpful. All the questions asked will be from the concepts taught. However 2 to 3 questions which carry almost 6 to 8 marks can be from what the professor mentioned in the class. No need to refer extra materials.
