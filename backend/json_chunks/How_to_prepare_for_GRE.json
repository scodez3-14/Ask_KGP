This can help in making the list of unremembered words after first iteration. Forming links: trying to forms links either through etymology or through synonyms or antonyms, this helps cluster the words as well as memorize them.

Power Prep: The authentic GRE stuff from ETS. Absolute must. It has practice questions and two CATs which can give the feel of actual GRE. Give it a shot around two weeks before the GRE to estimate your preparation.\n3. Barron\u2019s: There are practice questions in the start and 5 model tests in the end. The question at the start can be practised. The model tests are OK, though little less tough than actual GRE. They can be practised by keeping a lesser time frame.\n4.

It will get you acquainted with it. Also,The book Cracking the GRE has strategies for verbal questions which are very useful.\n\u2022 Verbal Practice can be started after say half of the words have been mugged or after first iteration is complete. Then, both practice and mugging can be done side by side.\n\u2022 Reading Comprehensions (RC) take most of the time and you can get 3 to 4 of them. If one had infinite time, then all RC questions could be tackled, but to do so in 30 minutes, apart from other questions and without making silly mistakes, it needs practice.\n\u2022 Computer based tests take more time than paper based tests. This is mostly due to RCs where you need to do a lot of scrolling. So while practicing on paper keep a time frame of say 27 minutes for the Verbal Section.\n\u2022 This is a strategy in case you are running out of time. Generally the last RC comes around 15th or 16th question. So, if you have 5 questions including an RC and say you have say 3 minutes left and the RC has 2 questions based on it, you can mark arbitrary answers for RC and move forward to answers the remaining 3 questions, which are likely to be non-RC and can be answered in 3 minutes easily.", "page": "How to prepare for GRE"}, {"chunk_id": "0562449b", "title": "Part 3: Analytical Writing", "text": "Just a few things which are important.

The stress is on reasoning and proving your argument. Some practice must be done to get used to the kind of writing that is needed.\n\u2022 You should know what score you want to achieve. It is written in Barron\u2019s that for streams like engineering and mathematics, analytical writing is not as important as the Verbal and Quantitative. So if you can get a score of 4.5 or 5 out of 6 it is good enough. Also depending on your flair in writing, you can decide how much time to spend time on it. If you think you have to improve to get a decent score, then start at least 4 weeks before exam.If you are good and can get a 5/6 easily (after seeing the sample essays) , then you can start to practice late.\n\u2022 Opening and concluding paragraphs are very important. They must be well written, and not rushed off. Apart from them, do write at least 3 paragraphs, having solid points, well-reasoned and with examples if possible.\n\u2022 Time it well. Both the issue task and argument task is 30 minutes each (no break, so 1 hr for 2 essays). More speed is needed as the time is 30 minutes for each individual essay and it must be practised more. While practising always time and do both the essays back-to-back to build up the stamina needed for the exam.\n\u2022 If you know about the logical fallacies, it can help in finding the fallacies in Argument Task.
