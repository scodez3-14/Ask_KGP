Finite difference (FDM), finite element (FEM) and boundary element methods (BEM) for modeling and analysis of manufacturing processes. Generalization of FE concepts \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2 weighted residual and variational approaches. Element types \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2 plane triangular, quadrilateral, curved isoparametric elements, 3-dimensional elements, axisymmetric, plate and shell elements. Automatic mesh generation and data visualization schemes. Mixed and hybrid finite element analysis: thermal modeling of manufacturing processes like induction hardening, arc welding, cooling of castings, forgings, cutting tools and consequent deduction of cooling rate and metallurgical transformations. Thermo-plastic modeling of forming processes like forging, extrusion and rolling. FE modeling of dynamic and non-linear problems.", "page": "ME60134: Numerical Modelling Of Manufacturing Processes"}, {"chunk_id": "ee253eb1", "title": "Concepts taught in class", "text": "Basic concepts about how to proceed with modelling,\nStress and Strain concepts\nIf taught by VR, Mostly focussed on Hands on Sessions - On Abaqus- Tractrix Die forming , 3 roller beam bending problem , On Ansys - Flow Over a Sphere.", "page": "ME60134: Numerical Modelling Of Manufacturing Processes"}, {"chunk_id": "28102a26", "title": "Student Opinion", "text": "If taught by VR, a lot of focus will be on simulation part.
