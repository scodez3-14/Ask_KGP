No.Titles of Experiments1Hardness measurements: Rockwell, Brinell, Vickers (Macro- and micro-hardness).2Tensile tests: Studying the effect of strain rate. Comparison of the stress-strain curves of Aluminium and mild steel. Determination of the Youngs modulus by tension tests and by ultrasonic device.3Compression tests: Study of the effect of specimen size (h/D ratio) and effect of lubrication. Ring compression test.4Charpy Impact tests: Study of impact energy of steels at low and ambient temperatures, and observation of fracture surfaces.5Creep tests: Tensile creep test to obtain creep curve and time to rupture, and observation of fracture surfaces.6Fatigue test: Determination of S-N curve for a steel sample, and observation of fracture surfaces.7Fracture toughness test: Determination of fracture toughness by three point bend tests on single edge notch bend tests, and observation of fracture surfaces.8Upset Ring Test using hydraulic press forging to determine interface friction factor (m).9Forward slip in rolling and determination of no-slip angle, coefficient of friction (\u00c3\u00c2\u00bc), Angle of Bite, maximum draft and maximum reduction.10Extrusion: Extrusion of lead at room temperature and study of flow lines.", "page": "MT39009: Mechanical Testing And Working Lab."}, {"chunk_id": "27ca2424", "title": "Time Table", "text": "Day | 8:00-8:55 am | 9:00-9:55 am | 10:00-10:55 am | 11:00-11:55 am | 12:00-12:55 pm | 2:00-2:55 pm | 3:00-3:55 pm | 4:00-4:55 pm | 5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday | MECHANICAL TESTING LAB | MECHANICAL TESTING LAB | MECHANICAL TESTING LAB\nTuesday | MECHANICAL TESTING LAB | MECHANICAL TESTING LAB | MECHANICAL TESTING LAB\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday", "page": "MT39009: Mechanical Testing And Working Lab."}]
