Each group's viva can go on to roughly 15 minutes and questions are mostly asked on different topic to each member of the group. The questions are according to experiments and, in worst cases, there could be cross questioning from the experiment your partner is being asked from. Below are some example questions:\n\u2022 What is a low pass filter and a high pass filter?\n\u2022 Draw the circuit for high pass filter with RC and RL components? Also draw the graph for it's characteristics.\n\u2022 What is 3dB cutoff frequency? Write the equation.\n\u2022 Draw the adder circuit.\n\u2022 Draw the circuit for inverting Op-Amp configuration.\nProf Gaurab Dutta :\nHe will give a sheet with 2 questions written on it. You have to solve the question. In case there is some error or anomaly in your answer, he will start asking you stuff. If everything is correct, not a single word conversation will take place.\nQuestions:\n\u2022 A 4 quadrant table was given with one axis as V(CE) and other V(BE) for an npn BJT. Write the regions of operation in each quadrant\n\u2022 Detailed graph of NPN BJT output characteristics (Early Effect was to be mentioned too)\n\u2022 Working of Zener diode\n\u2022 Working of Full wave (centre-tap and bridge) rectifier", "page": "EC29003: Introduction To Electronics Lab."}, {"chunk_id": "bea3bbfc", "title": "CIC Lab Test (Common for All):", "text": "A lab test is done in CIC soon after the viva for all the students taking the course.
