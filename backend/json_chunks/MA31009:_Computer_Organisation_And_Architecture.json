Attendance was a major factor in grade distribution, as well as going to department for assignments on occasional weekends. The semester exams are also modeled on his assignments. It is crucial to solve the questions carefully otherwise you will not get the correct answer in first try, which is what matters in exam. As for the overall course, it is easy to get B but difficult to rise up to A/EX and also to drop to C/D.", "page": "MA31009: Computer Organisation And Architecture"}, {"chunk_id": "ff1fb121", "title": "Autumn 2016", "text": "Taught by: Pawan Kumar He taught merely about puzzles, gave us a handful of assignments which required logical reasoning rather than the COaA concepts. Furthermore, there was a huge weightage on attendance, he definitely took attendance for the 8 AM classes and discarded the attendance if the class strength was more than 50%. He tries to fit a normal curve on the marks distribution for grading. This means that only 2-3 students get EX, but no one gets F too, and most of the class ends up getting B or C grade. No books were specified. The best thing was labwork (It carried attendance). That was the best learning experience. He would give you a simulation of Computer Architecture and you would have to think of logic to solve typical problems.
