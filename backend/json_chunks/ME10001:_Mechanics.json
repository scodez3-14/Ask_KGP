Generally good professors are assigned in this course, so they explain you much nicely that the only thing you need to do back in hostel is solve a selected number of problems and the Previous Year Papers. If thats not the case with you I would recommend you to watch JEFF HANSON videos on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/user/1234jhanson\nBe ready for step marking, so even if your answer is wrong you get credits for your procedure.\nAnd do solve problems from books: Merriem Kraige Statics http://aghababaie.usc.ac.ir/files/1506464236211.pdf and Beer Johnston Material MEchanics: http://www.hljp.edu.cn/attachment/20120820084627006.pdf and Statics : https://mechzoneblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/statics-and-mechanics-of-materials.pdf", "page": "ME10001: Mechanics"}, {"chunk_id": "e061e80d", "title": "Additional Resources", "text": "Instiinfo Repository", "page": "ME10001: Mechanics"}]
