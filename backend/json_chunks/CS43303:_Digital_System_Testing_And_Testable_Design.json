Fault equivalence and dominance; fault collapsing. Fault simulation: parallel, deductive and concurrent techniques; critical path tracing. Test generation for combinational circuits: Boolean difference, D-algorithm, Podem, etc. Exhaustive, random and weighted test pattern generation; aliasing and its effect on fault coverage. PLA testing: cross-point fault model, test generation, easily testable designs. Memory testing: permanent, intermittent and pattern-sensitive faults; test generation. Delay faults and hazards; test generation techniques. Test pattern generation for sequential circuits: time-frame expansion method, ad-hoc and structures techniques, scan path and LSSD, boundary scan. Built-in self-test techniques. Testing issues in embedded core based systems.References1.N. K. Jha and S. Gupta, Testing of Digital Systems, Cambridge University Press.2.M. L. Bushnell and V. D.
