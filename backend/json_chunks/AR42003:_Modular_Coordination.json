First, there will be an introduction to conventional modular principles and practices in the West in the early, medieval, industrial and post-industrial phases. There will an additional input on the vernacular theories of Modular principles in India. Second, typologies, means and methods of various structural systems (Form-active systems like cables and arches; surface-active systems like folded plates, Vector-active like trusses, bulk active like trabeated means and complex structures) based on natural and engineering knowledge-development will be covered. Third and last, the advanced and the contemporary themes of modular principles will invoke new theories of pattern, group organization, centering processes, Topology and 3-D mapping of space systems. There will be an additional input on non-linear theories, Symmetry, Hologram and Graphics in Modulation of various structures. Additionally, modular inputs on Logistics and networking will also be covered The coursework will equip the students with tools for basic research, development and real life applications of dimensional and functional coordination of modular systems.", "page": "AR42003: Modular Coordination"}]
