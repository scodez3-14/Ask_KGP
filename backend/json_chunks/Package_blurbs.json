Not talking about extremity but I don't like changing songs one after other when they finish playing. I repeat I don't like opening a new tab and then searching for a song after which I play it only when the current song ends playing. This chrome extension is a dark knight for people like us. Now you can add songs from whichever tab you want even when the current song is playing and like an obedient queue it will play each song one after other.", "page": "Package blurbs"}]
