The first batch of twenty B. Tech students graduated in 1961 and currently the sanctioned strength of the undergraduate program is 78 B. Tech students. The department has introduced a modern Mining Engineering curriculum in India, taking full advantage of the well-developed infrastructure for technical education at the institute. Over the years, the department has pioneered the offering of courses such as rock and geo-mechanics, mineral processing, numerical methods, geostatistics, GIS & remote sensing, GPS, reliability and quality engineering, safety engineering, environmental science and technology, industrial management, operations research, computer programming and network applications. The faculty is actively involved in sponsored research and industrial consultancy to maintain close relationships with the industry and to develop solutions for industrial problems. A number of continuing education programs for industry executives and teachers are offered on a regular basis. Facilities for research have been created over the years in the areas of fire and explosions, subsurface aerodynamics, experimental geomechanics, environmental quality assessment, mineral processing and numerical modeling. The tradition of inter-departmental research cooperation at IIT, Kharagpur significantly enriches the M. Tech. and Ph.D. programs of the department. This department has awarded more doctoral degrees in mining engineering than any other Institution in India. Quality facilities exist for computer-based investigations, and the students have access to a wide variety of engineering software, testing facilities, and analytical equipment available throughout the institute. The department strives to remain in the forefront of science and technology related to mining and natural resources engineering.\nProf. Khanindra Pathak is the current Head of the Department .
