Most of the course is based on Estimation theory and Prof. Anirban teaches it exactly as is from Steven Kay's SSP book. Estimation theory is mainly about inferering the parameters (population parameters) from a set of observable data and infering the parameters that influence their occuring. As the course under Anirban follows the book completely, it is really easy and straightforward to learn. SSP is a very fun course where one can expect to strengthen one's knowledge on Probablity and Signal Processing together. Prof. Anirban rarely talked about examples in real life where SSP can be of use, but the book does a very fine job in exposing the applications.\n-- Arun Patro (EE '18)", "page": "EE60102: Statistical Signal Processing"}, {"chunk_id": "b336ef82", "title": "How to Crack the Paper", "text": "The mid-semester paper is usually easy and covers simple concepts taught in class in the form of sums. There are a few derivation based questions in the paper as well which can be found in the example section of the chapters covered in the Steven M. Kay. It is advisable to go through the sums given in the class as assignment problems. It is also recommended to get hold of the previous year question paper from a senior as it is not available in the library website. Some problem patterns can be inferred from them, which helps in narrowing down the focus of preparation. The mid-semester paper is usually scoring.\nThere is a single class test held which has a weightage of 10 marks and the other 10 marks comes from the assignment submission. The class test is usually tricky which tests some basic concepts and the pattern of sums set are not available in the book. The end-semester paper consists of 6 questions of 10 marks each. Adequate time is available to complete the paper. Revising the assignment sums and previous year paper is useful. It is advisable to thoroughly revise the example sums from the Steven M. Kay for the portions which has been added new to the syllabus compared to previous years.", "page": "EE60102: Statistical Signal Processing"}, {"chunk_id": "29c63d0e", "title": "Additional Resources", "text": "\u2022 An Introduction to Statistical Signal Processing Volume I (Estimation Theory) by Steven M.
