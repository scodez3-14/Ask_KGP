Mid-semester has only a short online quiz and End-semester has around 90 minutes written examination. For project, first we need to select a topic and then we are assigned different professors according to our topics. We then continue our project work under the guidance of that professor. In my opinion, the main and most important task for the project is to choose a right topic.", "page": "HS62002: Science Of Happiness And Well-being"}, {"chunk_id": "9a3aea37", "title": "How to Crack the Paper", "text": "In 2019, during Mid-Semester we had only 15 minutes online quiz and that too we can give from hostel.
