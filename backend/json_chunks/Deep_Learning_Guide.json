Another path recently followed by deep learning enthusiasts is the Deep Learning specialization on Coursera . The specialization contains 5 courses with proper case studies. There is also a Udacity course developed with Google. You can select any of the above courses as per your schedule.\nAfter getting confident enough which you should try reading research papers, and implement some of them. One good resource for a collection of the most influential research paper is Deep Learning Roadmap .\nAnd try participating in Kaggle competitions.", "page": "Deep Learning Guide"}, {"chunk_id": "948cc228", "title": "Which tools", "text": "You should be comfortable to convert any research paper to code.

For example, to learn to play chess, if you knew the best move in every situation, you could train a supervised learning (SL) system with these ground-truth labels. If you only have an entire game followed by a win/loss binary signal, you could use reinforcement learning to learn to play in such a way that wins are maximised. Thus RL is more generally applicable than SL. For example, AlphaGo was trained to play the board game of Go in this way, beating the world champion in a spectacular televised match .\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) combines reinforcement learning with deep learning, using deep neural networks to learn directly from raw inputs, without hand-engineered features or domain-specific heuristics. In 2013 DeepMind arguably kicked off the growth of the field by showing impressive results using Deep RL to play Atari video games .\n\u2022 Resources by Deepmind\n\u2022 Spinning Up in Deep RL by OpenAI\n\u2022 Introduction to Reinforcement Learning with David Silver\n\u2022 Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction .
