This is mostly because there is no centralised process for collecting question papers and uploading them.\n\u2022 We are also talking to the professors in charge of conducting exams, to figure out if it is possible to obtain question papers directly, but decided not to wait, as it seems easier to just do it ourselves. If we get a large number of uploads, this expanded database should be quite useful for students.", "page": "MFQP"}, {"chunk_id": "b6dc97cd", "title": "How it works", "text": "\u2022 When people send us question papers to email id [email protected] , we verify that it's legible and correct, convert it to PDF, and host it online.\n\u2022 For the question papers available on the library, we crawl the library website to get a list of urls.\n\u2022 We build a database of urls to question papers, and tag them with year, subject code, semester, subject name. Most of this process is automated.\n\u2022 When a user visits the MFQP search page, they download the entire index of question papers (a few kb gzipped). We use a fast string matching library along with a custom ranking formula to provide instant results.\n\u2022 Source code: https://github.com/metakgp/mfqp/ and https://github.com/mfqp-source/", "page": "MFQP"}]
