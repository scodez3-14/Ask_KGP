Most common applications are in minimizing effort or cost, and maximizing output. Optimization Techniques are divided into two different types, namely Linear Models and Non-Linear Models. The mathematical statement of a linear model is stated as follows:\nFind <math> x_1, x_2, x_3,..., x_n </math> so as to\n<math>max/min : Z = \\sum_{j=0}^{n} c_j x_j, j=1,2,3...n </math>\nSubject to the conditions :\n<math>\\sum_{j=0}^{n} a_{ij} x_j (\\le,=,\\ge) b_i, i=1,2,3...m </math>\n<math> x_j\\ge0, j=1,2,3,...,n</math>", "page": "MA30014: Operation Research"}, {"chunk_id": "ea90900b", "title": "Additional Resources", "text": "\u2191 1.0 1.1 Verified by Nuwanda on 2016-02-16.", "page": "MA30014: Operation Research"}]
