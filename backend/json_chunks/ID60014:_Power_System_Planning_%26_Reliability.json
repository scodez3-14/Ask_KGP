Distribution System Planning and Automation: Factors affecting distribution system planning: load characteristics, substation site selection, substation expansion, other factors (primary voltage selection, feeder route selection, number of feeders, conductor size selection, total cost etc); planning techniques and models, role of computer in system planning; system automation. Design of Sub-transmission Lines and Distribution Substations: Sub-transmission; distribution substations, substation bus schemes, substation location and size; substation application curves. System Reliability: Basic definitions: outage, interruption, system interruption frequency index, customer interruption frequency index, load interruption index, customer interruption duration index; cost vs. system reliability; reliability planning procedure; Generation System reliability evaluation, transmission system reliability. impact of interconnected systems on reliability. distribution system reliability calculations. Markov processes and state transition model; application example to distribution system planning.", "page": "ID60014: Power System Planning %26 Reliability"}]
