The event spans three days of intense contests, spectacular presentations and nerve-breaking quizzes. Since its inception in 1994 , COMPOSIT provides an ideal platform for young metallurgists from all over the country to showcase their talent . On top of the events , eminent personalities and IIT professors deliver guest lectures . Workshops and Panel Discussions are organised. It provides students an opportunity of a lifetime to interact with the stalwarts in their field. As the years have rolled on , COMPOSIT has seen a huge increase in the number of participation and footfall of students from different parts of the country. Lastly, to conclude the fest , a cultural night is organised where popular bands like Somlata and Aces have performed in the past editions , leaving the participants with moments to cherish for a lifetime .", "page": "Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering"}]
