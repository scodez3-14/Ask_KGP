For few of the protocols we will be using latest research papers and its an updated course of all the protocols. It was taught by Ayantika Chatterjee and Arnab Sarkar . I never felt that they are going fast or not in sync with us, they go at a right pace and helps us understand better.", "page": "AT60008"}, {"chunk_id": "dece60b7", "title": "How to Crack the Paper", "text": "Just following the slides and completing the assignments is more than enough.
