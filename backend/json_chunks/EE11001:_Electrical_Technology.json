As far as the session of 2017-18 is concerned, the overall syllabus is as follows:\n1.DC Circuits(Certain topics like Non linear elements have been removed)\n2.AC Circuits\n3.3 Phase Circuits (Unbalanced load not in syllabus)\n4.Transients (Only 1st order transients in DC and AC circuits)\nIn most cases the midsem syllabus is upto this portion.\n5.Magnetic Circuits (hysteresis and eddy current losses(only qualtitaive), relays, an application of magnetic force, basic principles of stepper motor- these topics are not in syllabus)\n6.Single Phase transformers\n7.3 Phase Induction Motor(Squirrel cage only)\nThe entire syllabus comes in the Endsem paper.\nFrom the session of 2017-18, worksheet type question papers were started for this subject, implying limited space for solving a particular question.\nIn both midsem and endsem papers, there are a total of 6 questions out of which 5 are to be attempted. If someone attempts all 6, then the best 5 will be taken for marking. Each question has several subparts.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9RcWoqXmzaLTYUdnzKhF4bYug3GjGcEc\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1XaeVNXKsvzzeCAqstGAG1_io1FhxVyk\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1XaeVNXKsvxpQCpOL701qk4gR0DwDc57 (Machines)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5eh6DsKgSo (Auto trnsformer)", "page": "EE11001: Electrical Technology"}, {"chunk_id": "f3b46f51", "title": "Student Opinion", "text": "This is one of the most dreaded subjects in the 1st year curricula. First of all the paper will be completely numerical based, so get ready for hectic calculations(in my endsem paper, my calculator showed 'STACK ERROR' while solving a magnetic circuit ;] ). Nobody can assure you about the quality of professors you can get in your class. So the best thing is to study for yourself. Focus more on numericals rather than only reading theory.\nAs far as grading is concerned, if the coordinator and the profs teaching the subject are peaceful, then each student gets 3-5 Ex's. In 2016-17 when the cooordinator prof was a loaded one, each section had only one Ex. The subject has relative grading.\nIn midsems(comparatively easy) marks cross 50 (for those who have practised damn well may get 60) out of 60. However endsem is the biggest bouncer where even the best students get atmost 82 or 84, after which there is a big gap and marks get down from 70s.\nAttendance in classes and tutorials plays a very important role in your TA marks.\nThe tutorials are of 3 hours and are taken in a alternate manner with the lab. Infact EE19001 Lab marks has 40% weightage of your tutorial test marks and attendance. Try to take maximum help from the TAs by asking them to help you with each and every concept. However be careful, sometimes they might tell you a longer method. So verify it from your professor.\nThe biggest question is 'Where should I practise the numericals from?'. The only answer to this is 'Previous Year Question Papers' and Tutorial Sheets ( http://www.ee.iitkgp.ac.in/faci_et.php ) on the library website and DC++. There is no book that will ever reach the level of problems given in the paper. However this book might help you a lot : http://www.engineeringbookspdf.com/download/?file=2925 . https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0uVd31B7zGEWjRQNlJlX05vdms/edit this book also helps a lot. Also pay attention to your tutorial classes and those moments of time when your prof starts solving sums. I can recommend the pdf version of Thareja for some good questions, but dont rely on the answers.\nInfact for an idea of those complex AC DC circuit problems you can search for IES/ESE Conventional Papers for ECE and EE branches. Surprisingly they are very similar to the questions asked in exams.\nGenerally class tests are not taken. Be ready for a 30 minute 10 marks test in the beginning of the tutorial class. Do prepare well for it because it is the only thing to save you when your midsem and endsem marks go down.", "page": "EE11001: Electrical Technology"}, {"chunk_id": "d85f28c7", "title": "Additional Resources", "text": "Instiinfo Repository", "page": "EE11001: Electrical Technology"}]
