The players must alternate in striking the ball with their racquet and hit the ball onto the playable surfaces of the four walls of the court. The game was formerly called squash racquets, a reference to the \"squashable\" soft ball used in the game (compared with the harder ball used in its sister game racquets).\nIn Inter-IIT however, it is a purely singles team tournament where each team comprises of 4 players and of that 3 players play singles games of best of 5 sets. The first team to win 2 singles games wins the match. 9 teams in the Inter-IIT are divided into 2 groups of 5 and 4, and the top 2 from each group qualify for the semi-finals.
