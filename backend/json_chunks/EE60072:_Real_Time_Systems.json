Characteristic features of RT applications. Structural, Functional and Performance requirement of Reactive RTS. Distinctive features from Non-RT and Off-line system. Modelling RTS: Representation of time, Concurrency and Distributedness in discrete event systems, Hierarchical representation of complex DES. Input, Output and Communication. Examples of modelling practical systems as RT DES. Modelling programs as RTS. Analysing RTS: Analysing logical properties of DES such as Reachability, Deadlock etc. Analysing timing related properties. Specification and Verification of RT DES properties. Temporal logic, Model checking. Example of checking safety and timing properties of industrial systems. Requirements and features of real-time Computing Environments: Real-time Operating Systems, Interupts, clock, Device support, Multi tasking, Static and Dynamic Scheduling, Resource Allocation, Real-time Programming language with examples drawn from existing languages. Real-time communication systems.", "page": "EE60072: Real Time Systems"}]
