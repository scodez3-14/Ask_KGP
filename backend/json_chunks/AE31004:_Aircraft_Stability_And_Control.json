Autopilot, PIXHAWK used in drones and other aircraft avionics)is based. Basically the theory to understand how an aircraft is designed such that it is stable when it is up in the air. The essential idea is to bring you away from the conventional Free Body Diagram approach to more mathematical and an indirect approach to quantify the stability of the aircraft at times when you cannot draw FBD.", "page": "AE31004: Aircraft Stability And Control"}, {"chunk_id": "3b13d11c", "title": "Student Opinion", "text": "If course taught in right way or atleast if one try to understand this course by investing genuine efforts.
