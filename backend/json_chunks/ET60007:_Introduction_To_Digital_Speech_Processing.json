This course is intended for students who are familiar with digital processing concepts, preferably those who are majoring in electronics or electrical engineering. Try to be in sync with the NPTEL lectures, otherwise you will get bored. Prof doesn't take attendance, hence you may find very small population, hardly 10. But, here is the tip: Attend the classes regularly if you are aiming for an EX.", "page": "ET60007: Introduction To Digital Speech Processing"}, {"chunk_id": "e16fc21a", "title": "How to Crack the Paper", "text": "Getting an EX in this course is quite easy. The exam paper (both midsem and endsem) consists of two parts: A and B.\nPart A contains short answer type questions. Most questions from this part are similar to the assignment problems available on NPTEL. Hence, do the assignments very thoroughly.\nPart B contains long answer type questions that requires lot of calculations. For acing this part, all you need to make notes of every formula used in this course (with proper explanations what particular term signifies). That's it. That's easy.", "page": "ET60007: Introduction To Digital Speech Processing"}, {"chunk_id": "751391ba", "title": "Classroom resources", "text": "Study material can be found on bit.ly/iitkgpece 3rd sem > Slides and Assignments > Digital Speech Processing.", "page": "ET60007: Introduction To Digital Speech Processing"}, {"chunk_id": "dd71f7d9", "title": "Time Table", "text": "Day | 8:00-8:55 am | 9:00-9:55 am | 10:00-10:55 am | 11:00-11:55 am | 12:00-12:55 pm | 2:00-2:55 pm | 3:00-3:55 pm | 4:00-4:55 pm | 5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday | CET Studio-1\nThursday | CET Studio-1\nFriday | CET Studio-1 | CET Studio-1", "page": "ET60007: Introduction To Digital Speech Processing"}]
