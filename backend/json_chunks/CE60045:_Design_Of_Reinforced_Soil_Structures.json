This course aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the design of such structures starting from first principles. Credit: {(3-0-0) 3 credits}Syllabus: Introduction; Principle, concept and mechanism of reinforced earth; Materials used: geotextiles, geogrids, geocells, geonets, geomembranes, geo-composites and natural fiber products; Functions: separation, reinforcement, filtration, drainage and containment; Evaluation of properties: index properties, strength properties, apparent opening size, in-plane and cross-plane permeability, assessment of construction induced damage, extrapolation of long term strength properties from short term tests; Design of reinforced soil retaining walls, embankments, slopes, foundations and pavements; Designing for filtration and drainage, Application in the construction of landfills and erosion control, Case histories.Teachers: Prof. Sujit Dash, Prof Kousik DebReferences: 1.
