The vision behind it is to promote and encourage student activities, research projects, and relevant courses related to this field. Besides the students, a large number of faculty members from various departments are part of this center.\nCentre for Excellence in Robotics received its first funding from IIT Kharagpur in 2015.", "page": "Centre for Excellence in Robotics"}, {"chunk_id": "369e5ce9", "title": "History", "text": "Robotics as a field is expanding all across the world. So in order to keep up, a proposal for a Centre for Excellence in Robotics was drafted with the initiative of Prof. Partha Pratim Chakrabarti, Current Director with the help of multiple professors and Nalin Gupta, a final year student and then Student Coordinator of AGV in August 2014. This included 10 robotics project proposals from multiple departments, students and professors. [ 1 ]\nIn December 2014, the proposal was accepted which finally included 12 projects and a total fund of 5 Crores approved through the Institute and Centre for Excellence in Robotics was kick-started with Prof. D.K.Pratihar as it's Overall Coordinator. Currently, all 12 projects are running independently funded through Sponsored Research and Industrial Consultancy ( SRIC ).
