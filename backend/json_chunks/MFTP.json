At this time, it was required to repeatedly reload the ERP interface to check for new notices, which led to them missing several important notices, and nearly missing an urgent notice about a change in interview timing.\nMFTP works by repeatedly logging into ERP using some user's credentials, downloading the last few hundred notices, diffing them with previously fetched notices, and constructing updates out of new or changed notices. Notice attachments are also diffed, and are attached directly to the emails sent out. Email updates are easily filtered by a user's mail client. The mail + attachment format also has the advantage of being easily searchable in most mail clients.\nThe first design involved users subscribing for email notifications directly on an MFTP web interface. However, Ppsreejith proposed the idea of using a Google Group, which seemed far simpler, and this was used for the final implementation. The Google Group has the disadvantage that anyone, including people from outside KGP, can ask to join the group. A simple question requiring knowledge of KGP serves as a minor gateway for entry into the group, to discourage casual outsiders from joining.", "page": "MFTP"}, {"chunk_id": "268fa4c8", "title": "External links", "text": "\u2022 MFTP Google Group\n\u2022 Source code on GitHub", "page": "MFTP"}]
