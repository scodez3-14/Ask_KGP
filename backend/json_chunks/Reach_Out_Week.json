[ 2 ] [ 3 ] These two unfortunate events prompted the authorities to take up initiatives and address the situation on a larger scale. The third edition of Anamaya, a NSO IIT Kharagpur newsletter summarizes the campaign in following words: [ 1 ]\nWe had a reach out program for the students that came with fun games, activities and a blackout, but most importantly, it came with a message, a message that you are not alone. Every problem, every situation can be dealt with the right kind of help and sharing your fears and anxieties with your friends, family and teachers (who were an integral part of this program). In the end, the newsletter team wishes you good (mental and physical) health, mourns the loss of two students and hopes that the tragic accident will be taken as a lesson for something that hopefully will never be repeated again. Reach out, stay healthy and keep asking yourself and the others...R U OK?
